# Bike Sharing

## Overview of the Analysis
###### The purpose of this analysis was to create visualizations of bike sharing data that could be shared with potential investors. Tableau was used to create visualizations of data from Citi bikes used in New York City. Data included top start and end locations, duration, gender, age, user type (subscriber vs. customer), and checkout times. This analysis answered questions such as, when are Citi bikes used the most? Where do Citi bike trips start most often? Who is using Citi bikes the most?

## **Results**

###### The majority of Citi bike users are males.

## **Summary**
###### Based on the results we can see Citi bikes are most often used in denser areas of the city with more attractions. They are also most often used during afternoons and weekdays, at least during the month of August. Male subscribers are the most common users. To plan for opening a bike sharing business, it would be good for bikes to be in the center of the city and near large offices. Additionally, it is important to have ample bikes available during the afternoons, with maintenance conducted during early morning hours. To further this analysis, it could be useful to create a visualization that differentiates start and ending locations by user type (subscriber vs. customer). Subscriber users may be more likely to have consistent start and ending locations, whereas start and ending locations for customers (such as tourists) may be more variable. The amount of bikes at different locations could be adjusted to ensure subscribers will have access to a bike. An additional visualization could show the number bike repairs by starting and ending location. If bikes more frequenlty need to be repaired in a given area, that may suggest that bike station should be moved. Finally, it would be useful to analyze data from other months.
